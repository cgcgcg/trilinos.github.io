Welcome to the Stratimikos Home

Stratimikos contains a unified set of wrappers to linear solver and preconditioner capabilities in Trilinos. Stratimikos essentially consists of the single class DefaultLinearSolverBuilder. This class takes as input a (nested) parameter list that contains options for the desired solvers and preconditioners.

Stratimikos has adapters for Belos, Amesos2, Ifpack2, and MueLu.
