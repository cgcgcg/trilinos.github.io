**Welcome to the Tempus Home**

_Tempus is a Latin word meaning time as in “tempus fugit” -> “time flies”._
 
The Tempus package is a time-integration framework for advanced transient analysis, including various time integrators and embedded sensitivity analysis for next-generation code architectures.  This framework provides “out-of-the-box” time-integration capabilities, which allows users to supply governing equations and easily switch between various time integrators, and also “build-your-own” capabilities, which allows applications to incorporate various Tempus components to augment or replace application transient capabilities.  A variety of time steppers are available, e.g., Forward/Backward Euler, Trapezoidal, Explicit Runge-Kutta, Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta, Implicit/Explicit Runge-Kutta, Leapfrog, Newmark-Beta, HHT-Alpha, BDF2, operator-splitting, and subcycling.  Other capabilities include embedded error analysis, sensitivity analysis, transient optimization with ROL.
